                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4" style="font-size: 20px;">To start the problem definition & brainstorming process, we were asked to complete a full empathy and journey map for each of the four initial interviews we conducted. We did this by sitting down and talking through all of the interview notes for each interview and then categorizing where they would fall into the journey/empathy maps. We were glad to do the empathy maps together, not separately, because firstly it gave us a better way to brainstorm phrasing what we heard, and secondly it served as an interview debrief, so we had already completed that step. We tried to take note of critical details and recurring themes throughout the four interviews as they would help us narrow our thinking in the coming steps.

                                <p class="lead fw-normal text-white-50 mb-4">Once we had all of our empathy and journey maps completed, we could then move on to the next step of problem definition. To start this process, we first went back through all of our initial interviews and did a thematic analysis to narrow down recurring issues people in our interviews had with noise in their dorms. Using the recurring theme, we were able to start drafting insight statements; these came out to be:
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This person is woken up when they hear noises at night
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This person asks their suitemates what happened when they hear something loud
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This person acknowledges that quiet hours are enforced but doesn't care
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This person acknowledges that quiet hours are enforced and is annoyed
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This person acknowledges that quiet hours are enforced and feels disrespected
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Our next task was to take our five insight statements and convert them into how might we statements. After some reworking, we converted the insight statements into four key how might we statements:
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Make ppl less noisy at night (respect quiet hours)?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Streamline partygoers getting back into their dorms at night?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                How can we make the room feel like it's an enclosed space?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                How might we help a student sleep in a noisy environment?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Finally, with the "how might we" statements done, we were able to move to the final step, brainstorming solutions. We did a rapid brainstorming section for each of the four "how might we" statements, with each consisting of five minutes of constant ideas. In these twenty total minutes, we were able to come up with almost seventy possible solution ideas. While we had a large quantity of ideas, our next step was to narrow the 70+ ideas down to the three to five best solutions. Through a detailed organization and then a final selection process, we got down to four main ideas:
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Noise Insolations
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Social Rewards
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Bed Modifications
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Public dorm Modifications
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                While all four of these ideas seemed viable, for the final step, we needed to make a final selection of the four ideas that best fit the needs of our intended user. After some group discussion, we unanimously agreed on Noise insulation as our most desirable solution.

                        We feel that our feedback session<br>
                        Their feedback was that<br>
                        Think it's good that there is a website for a guideline and a place to buy it (brandeis store)<br>
                        It seems like it is pretty realistic as a design that could be used for students<br>
                        I could just buy stuff from amazon if its cheaper<br>
                        Yes, that’s part of our design, is guiding you to the cheapest and best products that you can use to fit your dorm.<br>
                        What stops you from buying earplugs?<br>
                        It’s that they are uncomfortable and fall out.<br>
                        An idea we got was a soundproofing poster like an ad<br>
                        Another idea was to add it to one of the brandeis stores<br>
                        Successfully justified the need for the solution.<br>
                        We explained that a subset of Brandeis students felt as if they needed a solution to sound, and that was our target audience.<br>
                        Then we justified our design specifically.<br>
                        For example, when asked “why wouldn’t someone just buy soundproofing materials themselves?” we responded, “Well, have you?” and the answer was no. As our reviewers pointed out, this revealed that a big part of our design was dispersing the information about soundproofing.<br>
                        For instance, there are restrictions regarding the Brandeis dorms that we can point to on our website<br>
                        The principles that have emerged from feedback are informing, tailoring, and guiding, synthesizing.<br>
                        We are to inform Brandeis students what soundproofing is. By informing them how to test their room for sound leaks, we are to tailor their solution to their room. By guiding them, we can lead them to the best thing to buy (on or off campus). They can use these to synthesize their own solution, for instance, combining command hooks from the campus bookstore (because Brandeis’s policy limits adhesive use to only command hooks) mixed with our own manufactured curtain hook (or one off of amazon that gets the job done too). These are our guiding principles.<br>
                        Our partner principles are to make demystify soundproofing and make it easy to do as a Brandeis student with limited resources and restrictions on what you can do to your dorm. We want to leave students feeling more insulated in their room, and like they have more control over their dorm.<br>
                        <br>
                        Refining how might we statement<br>
                        Make ppl less noisy at night (respect quiet hours)? -> make people morr informed about where noise is coming from.<br>
                        Streamline partygoers getting back into their dorms at night? -> drop it make the focus about students being in their dorms.<br>
                        Keep these two the same <br>
                        How to make the room feel like its an enclosed space? <br>
                        How might we help a student in a noisy environment sleep? <br>
                        Add this one:<br>
                        How might we make a student feel like they understand soundproofing?<br>
                        <br>
                        Analyze<br>
                        Our first task as to successfully define a problem, and the need for our solution. We emphasized that our target audience consists of Brandeis students seeking noise control but lacking the necessary information or resources to achieve it. When asked why students wouldn’t buy soundproofing materials independently, responses often confirmed our hypothesis: they didn’t know where to start or how to navigate dorm restrictions. They didn’t know if soundproofing would even be effective or worth the cost. This feedback reinforced our prototype's primary function as an informational and guiding tool.<br>
                        Our feedback session provided valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of our prototype. One consistent piece of feedback was an appreciation for having a centralized website that not only guides students on soundproofing their dorms but also provides direct access to materials at the Brandeis store. Users felt this was a realistic and practical design that could integrate seamlessly into the student experience. Other concerns included the comfort and usability of soundproofing products, such as earplugs, which some users found uncomfortable and prone to falling out. For this reason, soundproofing the room felt justified and well-motivated.<br>
                        A recurring critique was cost sensitivity. We resolved to use our website to guide users to the most cost-effective products, as they pointed out they might still opt for Amazon if it offers cheaper alternatives. In response, we emphasized that our design guides users toward cost-effective solutions that fit their dorm-specific needs. This clarification resonated with them and reinforced the value of our approach.<br>
                        This led to an innovative suggestion: create a soundproofing poster in the style of informational ‘move in’ or ‘community resources’ posters. Users also proposed making soundproofing products available at Brandeis stores for convenience, aligning with campus policies and accessibility.<br>
                        Prioritize<br>
                        From the feedback, we identified the following guiding principles:<br>
                        Inform: Educate Brandeis students about soundproofing and its benefits, addressing gaps in knowledge and misconceptions.<br>
                        Tailor: Help students customize solutions to their dorm’s specific needs, considering factors such as sound leaks and campus policies.<br>
                        Guide: Provide curated recommendations for materials, whether from Brandeis stores or external platforms, ensuring cost-effectiveness and compatibility.<br>
                        Synthesize: Enable students to combine resources (e.g., command hooks from the campus store and curtain hooks from Amazon) to create personalized solutions.<br>
                        Levels of Principles<br>
                        Partner Principles: Demystify soundproofing for Brandeis students, making it accessible and achievable even with limited resources and dorm restrictions. Ensure the solution leaves students feeling more in control and insulated in their dorms.<br>
                        Design Principles: Ensure functionality (soundproofing materials work), interaction (students can easily access, understand, and implement the solution), and character (the solution feels tailored and trustworthy).<br>
                        Designer Principles: Uphold values of simplicity, inclusivity, and cost-effectiveness while adhering to campus policies.<br>
                        (Re)Define and Ideate<br>
                        Define<br>
                        Reflecting on the feedback, we revised our How Might We (HMW) statements:<br>
                        Original: How might we make people less noisy at night (respect quiet hours)?<br>
                        Revised: How might we make people more informed about where noise is coming from?<br>
                        Original: How might we streamline partygoers getting back into their dorms at night?<br>
                        Dropped: The focus shifted to students within their dorms, so we dropped this HMW statement.<br>
                        Unchanged: How might we make the room feel like an enclosed space?<br>

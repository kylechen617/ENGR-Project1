                        <p class="text-white-75 mb-4" style="font-size: 20px;">To start the problem definition & brainstorming process, we were asked to complete a full empathy and journey map for each of the four initial interviews we conducted. We did this by sitting down and talking through all of the interview notes for each interview and then categorizing where they would fall into the journey/empathy maps. We were glad to do the empathy maps together, not separately, because firstly it gave us a better way to brainstorm phrasing what we heard, and secondly it served as an interview debrief, so we had already completed that step. We tried to take note of critical details and recurring themes throughout the four interviews as they would help us narrow our thinking in the coming steps.

                                <p class="lead fw-normal text-white-50 mb-4">Once we had all of our empathy and journey maps completed, we could then move on to the next step of problem definition. To start this process, we first went back through all of our initial interviews and did a thematic analysis to narrow down recurring issues people in our interviews had with noise in their dorms. Using the recurring theme, we were able to start drafting insight statements; these came out to be:
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This person is woken up when they hear noises at night
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This person asks their suitemates what happened when they hear something loud
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This person acknowledges that quiet hours are enforced but doesn't care
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This person acknowledges that quiet hours are enforced and is annoyed
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This person acknowledges that quiet hours are enforced and feels disrespected
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Our next task was to take our five insight statements and convert them into how might we statements. After some reworking, we converted the insight statements into four key how might we statements:
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Make ppl less noisy at night (respect quiet hours)?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Streamline partygoers getting back into their dorms at night?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                How can we make the room feel like it's an enclosed space?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                How might we help a student sleep in a noisy environment?
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Finally, with the "how might we" statements done, we were able to move to the final step, brainstorming solutions. We did a rapid brainstorming section for each of the four "how might we" statements, with each consisting of five minutes of constant ideas. In these twenty total minutes, we were able to come up with almost seventy possible solution ideas. While we had a large quantity of ideas, our next step was to narrow the 70+ ideas down to the three to five best solutions. Through a detailed organization and then a final selection process, we got down to four main ideas:
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Noise Insolations
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Social Rewards
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Bed Modifications
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Public dorm Modifications
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                While all four of these ideas seemed viable, for the final step, we needed to make a final selection of the four ideas that best fit the needs of our intended user. After some group discussion, we unanimously agreed on Noise insulation as our most desirable solution.
